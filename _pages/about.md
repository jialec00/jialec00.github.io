Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


I am a third-year Ph.D. student in operations research at Stanford University, advised by <a href="https://www.aaronsidford.com/">Prof. Aaron Sidford</a>. Previously, I obtained my B.Sc., Summa Cum Laude in Computer Science and Technology from Turing Class, Peking University, advised by <a href="https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/yuqkong/">Prof. Yuqing Kong</a>.

During my undergraduate years, I am fortunate to have worked closely with <a href="https://procaccia.info/">Prof. Ariel Procaccia</a> on Fair Division and with <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/hartline/">Prof. Jason Hartline</a> on Algorithmic Fairness.

My research interests are in the design and analysis of algorithms with a current focus on matching algorithms in various settings.
